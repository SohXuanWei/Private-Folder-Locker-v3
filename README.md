# Private-Folder-Locker-v3
Upgraded version of the v2 private folder locker script

# What's New?
- User can now change their passwords, no more predefined password.
- Uses hash feature in 7z to compare password hashes, instead of directly comparing plaintext passwords.

# Potential improvements to be made:
- Adding a 'hint' feature in case users forget their password and the 7z file is forever locked. (happened to me :pain:)
